Free high quality public domain audiobooks on you website for your users to enjoy. http://www.bookjive.com/wiki/Audiobook_Plugin

== Description ==

demo: www.bookjive.com/blog/

I've created this plugin to help distribute and share some of the fantastic public domain audio books that are out there on the web. Most of the audio books came from librivox.org. I've been very selective when it comes to choosing audio books to include because there are lots of audio books available but the quality varies so much that is makes it difficult to find the ones worth listening to. I've also done some audio editing on these to reduce background noise, broken up all the audio files into single chapters to make navigation easier, and removed the annoying librivox announcements at the beginning of each chapter. I've put a lot of work into this and I really hope you'll enjoy it. There are some great audio books here that are almost professional quality. Thank you to all those who have spent the time making them. If you'd like to help please contact me. I'd also appreciate any comments, feedback or bug reports.
